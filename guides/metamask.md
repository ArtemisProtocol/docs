# Add Harmony to Metamask

Metamask is an extension for accessing Dapps such as Artemis.

### Installing Metamask

Click [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) to install the Metamask extension on your browser.

### Setting up Metamask

By default Metamask supports the Ethereum blockchain, but since Harmony is EVM compatible it can be used the same way by setting a custom RPC.

In order to connect to the Harmony Network, open Metamask and on top click on the network you are connected to and then select **Custom RPC**. Fill it as it follows:

| Field                             | Mainnet                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Network Name**                  | `Harmony Mainnet`               |
| **New RPC URL**                   | `https://api.harmony.one`       |
| **Chain ID**                      | `1666600000`                    |
| **Currency symbol (optional)**    | `ONE`                           |
| **Block Explorer URL (optional)** | `https://explorer.harmony.one/` |
