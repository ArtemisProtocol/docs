# Bridge: Fantom --> Harmony

> Step 1:

If you haven’t already, [add Harmony Mainnet to your Metamask](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/wallets/browser-extensions-wallets/metamask-wallet).

> Step 2:

Go to [SpookySwap](https://spookyswap.finance/) and connect your Metamask wallet to both Fantom Opera and SpookySwap’s website. You will need Fantom BNB to continue (You can get it [here](https://spookyswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xd67de0e0a0fd7b15dc8348bb9be742f3c5850454\))).

> **Step 3:**

On the Bridge tab, choose Fantom on ‘_From Chain ’_ and on ‘_To Chain’_ choose BSC. Choose BNB as the token to bridge and confirm the transactions. After the bridging is complete, you should see BNB on your BSC Network Metamask.

> Step 4:

Go to [https://bridge.harmony.one/](https://bridge.harmony.one/erc20); on the right side, choose Binance and click on both Metamask promts.  Now make sure you are bridging from Binance > One and choose BNB. Select the amount you’d like to bridge and click on _‘Use my address’ ._ Click on _‘Continue’_ and confirm the following transactions.

That’s all, you should now see your bscBNB on your Harmony’s Metamask account. You can swap BNB for ONE on [https://game.defikingdoms.com/#/](https://game.defikingdoms.com/#/) or [https://viperswap.one/](https://viperswap.one/)
