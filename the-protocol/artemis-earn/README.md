![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Group 3225.png>)

Artemis Earn is a yield generating platform built on Artemis Protocol that aims to offer attractive returns for risk-keen users through three built-in products: liquidity mining, staking and vault strategies. Its goal? To fairly distribute MIS and allow participation in Artemis Governance and Launchpad / Incubator based products.

Artemis Earn has no account freezes, minimum / maximum deposits or signup requirements and it can be used by anyone in the world with access to a WiFi connection. **Yield simplified, with friction-less access.**
