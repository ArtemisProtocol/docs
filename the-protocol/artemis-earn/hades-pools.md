# Hades Pools

Liquidity Mining (Elysium) is an efficient way to distribute Artemis' Governance token MIS, however, it is at the cost of inflation and supply expansion. Presenting the Hades Pools, a product built on Artemis Earn that allows users to burn MIS in return for rewards in tokens distributed over a set period of time. Hades Pools are 100% deflationary, as rewards are not minted (such as is the case with Elysium), but rather allocated.

Once MIS is deposited in a Hades Pool, it can't be withdrawn

### How Hades Works

* When the Hades smart contract is deployed, a timeframe and reward allocation is defined. The timeframe will usually be around 2/3 months, and since rewards are not minted, they have to be allocated by a developer/multisig wallet/vault.
* Once live, any user can deposit MIS tokens to the Hades Pools, these are held in the contract, which will send the tokens to a dead address over time, once deposited, **MIS tokens can't be withdrawn.**
* Once deposited, the user will earn rewards on every block (\~2s), the rewards can be claimed at any time. Depending on the amount of MIS deposited in the pool, the returns for it will be higher or lower: the less MIS deposited, the higher the returns.
* After a set period of time (before rewards end), users will stop being able to deposit MIS into the Hades Pools, however, rewards for already deposited users will still be distributed until those run out.

### &#x20;MIS Hades Pools

The MIS Hades Pools will be the first proof of product of these pools, 100,000 from the multisig vault will be allocated over a period of 2 months, users will be able to deposit during the first month, after it, deposits will be locked. The MIS deposited will be burnt, and since rewards are not minted, but rather allocated, then these pools are completely deflationary.
