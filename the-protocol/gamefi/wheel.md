# The Wheel

The Casino has a built in wheel that allows users to bet on the wheel randomly landing on a certain number out of the following list:

`[50,0,3,0,5,1,3,0,10,3,1,5,1,20,1,3,0,3,1,5,0,10,1,3,5,1,0,1,3,0,5,1,3,0,10,5,1,3,1,20,1,3,1,5,0,3,0,5,0,10,3,1]`

When a user bets on a number and the wheel doesn't land in it: 30% of the MIS is burned and 70% is sent to the Casino Treasuries. The following happens if an user bets on a number and the wheel lands in it:

0 - 0x your bet - example: 1 MIS bet = 0 MIS payout.

1 - 2x your bet - example: 1 MIS bet = 2 MIS payout.

3 - 3x your bet - example: 1 MIS bet = 3 MIS payout.

5 - 5x your bet - example: 1 MIS bet = 5 MIS payout.

10 - 10x your bet - example: 1 MIS bet = 10 MIS payout.

20 - 20x your bet - example: 1 MIS bet = 20 MIS payout.

50 - 50x your bet - example: 1 MIS bet = 50 MIS payout.
