# GameFi

GameFi has taken everyone by surprise, it has been growing without signs of weakness in the past months and is not slowing down. For this reason, Artemis implemented a 'Games' platform to the protocol that would require users to acquire MIS either through Artemis Earn or by swapping to it. Upon launch, Artemis will feature a Lottery and The Wheel, both will help offset emissions by burning MIS. Soon after launch we will announce a partnership that will bring a third game to the platform, and finally, we aim to implement multiplayer card games.
