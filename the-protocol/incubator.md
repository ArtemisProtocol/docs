# Incubator

The Incubator is the core of Artemis fair token distribution capabilities for new projects. Our vision is for it to become the go-to liquidity as a service solution, where project owners set up farms in a permissionless manner to distribute their tokens.&#x20;

Say Alice is working on a project and launched her coin ($ALI). Understandably, wants to fairly distribute it to holders while building liquidity for it, what Alice could do is visit Artemis, and seamlessly set up a MIS<>ALI farm that rewards farmers in ALI. Artemis governance would then review ALI and flag the project based on a set criteria.

We will release more information on the Incubator in the coming days.
