# xMIS

xMIS will be a vested version of MIS based veCRV contracts: users would lock MIS for a certain amount of time and be rewarded for it in yield from Vaults fees, non-native incentivized liquidity pools fees and fees from Artemis GameFi platform - all while gaining access to xMIS. From there, holders can then earn yield on it by pairing xMIS to xToken in return of MIS. We aim to make of xMIS our governance token.

{% hint style="info" %}
xMIS will go live on Q4 2021, stay tuned!
