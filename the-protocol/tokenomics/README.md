# MIS | Tokenomics

The core architecture of Artemis Protocol is based on the Artemis (Ticker: MIS) token. It works as a gate-away to all our decentralized applications and to our Governance participation system. Users wishing to participate in any of the protocol's products will have to acquire MIS either through swapping for it, or by leveraging our Earn platform.

## Supply and Emission Schedule

1,350,000 MIS tokens will be pre-minted, of which:

* **500,000 MIS:** Allocated to the ArtemisPad sale to be fairly distributed.
* **400,000 MIS:** Allocated for initial liquidity. These tokens will be paired with Wrapped ONE to form the initial liquidity pool and will be sent to a dead address as a safety measure.
* **50,000 MIS: **Allocated to the GameFi platform rewards treasuries. Note that 50,000 tokens will be permanently locked inside of The Wheel smart contract.
* **300,000 MIS: **Allocated to a multi-sig wallet that will be controlled by 2 founding members and 2 3rd party trusted community members. It will be used to cover the cost of hires and marketing as the protocol grows.
* **100,000 MIS:** Allocated for pre-launch bounties and dev hours of the founding team rewarded upon launch of the initial liquidity pool.

MIS has no hard cap, however, as our ecosystem grows, we aim to grow our deflationary mechanisms and attempt to stay below a set threshold. We strive to create enough utility and demand in our other decentralized applications to create a natural inflation control mechanism. In an ideal case, once our whole ecosystem is in place, we can express it as,

$$
∀m,∃n/n≥m
$$

`Where (m = MIS emmited per block) and (n = MIS being burnt)`
