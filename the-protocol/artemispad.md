# ArtemisPad

### Introduction

The ArtemisPad, a token launchpad for forthcoming projects in the Harmony ecosystem, is one of Artemis' first integrated products, and its most fundamental one. We aim to decentralize the way ideas raise capital, by aligning the interests of both users and creators via attractive incentives and yields.&#x20;

The ArtemisPad allows projects to list its tokens at a fixed price, which will be maintained for as long as there is time remaining in the sale. This ensures less volatility around a token launch and allows a project and its investors increased transparency over the amount of money raised and tokens sold. Fixed price commits solve three fundamental problems:

1. Unfair token distribution and liquidity rug-pulls.
2. Prevents token dumps by private and seed investors.
3. Reduces token offering costs on decentralized exchanges.

Projects wishing to distribute tokens through the ArtemisPad will be reviewed by[ Harmony Universe](https://harmonyuniverse.one), a platform known as the central hub for Harmony Protocol projects, once the review is published, Artemis Governance will fairly decide if the project should be launched on the platform through voting.

### User Workflow

Users lock MIS as collateral in order to be whitelisted during the sale, these then commit Wrapped ONE to buy the tokens being sold. The system follows an overflow sales method, in which users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the token sale, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale. In the case all the funds targeted aren't raised, the sale will proceed as normal, and all funds contributed will be spent.

### What happens after launch?

Projects wishing to launch on Artemis will not only be able to raise capital for liquidity and to cover development costs, but also will be rewarded for it by Artemis, this includes taking part in our incubator and incentivized liquidity pools, as well as being able to apply to the Artemis Hunt incentives program.
