# ArtemisPad

### Introduction

ArtemisPad, a token launchpad for forthcoming projects in the Harmony ecosystem, will be one of Artemis first integrated products. We aim to decentralize the way ideas raise capital, by aligning interests of both users and creators via attractive incentives and yields. 

The ArtemisPad will allow projects to list at a fixed price, which will be maintained for as long as there are tokens remaining in the available supply for sale. This should ensure less volatility around a token launch and allows a project and its investors increased transparency over the amount of money raised and tokens sold. Fixed price commits solve three fundamental problems:

1. Unfair token distribution and liquidity rug pulls.
2. Prevents token dumps by private and seed investors.
3. Reduces token offering costs on decentralized exchanges.

When in work, projects wishing to distribute tokens through the ArtemisPad will be reviewed by[ Harmony Universe](https://harmonyuniverse.one), a platform known as the central hub for Harmony Protocol projects, once the review is published, Artemis Governance will fairly decide if the project should be launched on the platform through voting.

### How it works

Participating projects raise funds through initial farm offerings, in which users deposit MIS and ONE liquidity pair tokens and commit them to buy the tokens being sold. The system follows an overflow sales method, in which users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the token sale, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale. In the case all the funds targeted aren't raised, the sale will proceed as normal, and all funds contributed will be spent.

The liquidity tokens collected will then be unpaired, both MIS and ONE tokens will be added as liquidity for the token and then burnt.

### What happens after launch?

Projects wishing to launch on Artemis will not only be able to raise capital for liquidity, but also will be rewarded for it, this includes taking part in our incubator pools, solo staking and incentivized liquidity pools.
