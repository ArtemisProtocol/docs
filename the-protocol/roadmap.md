# Roadmap

### Phase 1 **—** Genesis

Genesis will see the inception of Artemis, also known as the building phase, our main focus will be on developing a healthy and active community, which one day will become the core of our DAO and Governance. We will launch the first draft of our official Documentation and Artemis landing website, which will serve as a gateaway to our decentralized applications. What follows is marketing and outreach, by partnering with youtubers, community members and AMAs across all social media, we will restlessly work until every Harmony community member to knows what Artemis Protocol is.

### Phase 2 **—** Governance

This will see the launch of MIS, our HRC-20 governance token (refer to [Tokenomics](https://artemis-protocol.gitbook.io/artemis-protocol/roadmap/liquidity-mining) &[ Governance Model ](https://artemis-protocol.gitbook.io/artemis-protocol/governance-model)for more information about it) with the first glance to one of Artemis' most fundamental products. The launch will partake on the Artemis Launchpad ([ArtemisPad](https://artemis-protocol.gitbook.io/artemis-protocol/the-protocol/launchpad)) and users will be able to participate in the token sale for 4 complete [epochs](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators/definitions/epoch-transition) by committing Wrapped ONE, \~2 blocks before the epochs complete, we will add liquidity and immediately transfer the LP tokens to a [dead address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).
