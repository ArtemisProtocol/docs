# Governance Model

Artemis aims to be ultimately governed by its community, via forum discussions and voting proposals held on the upcoming Artemis Snapshot. With the implementation of xMIS (a vested version of MIS), we aim to make of it the core of Artemis governance, until that point, MIS will serve as the gateaway to Artemis Governance.

Although not an easy task by any means, our goal is to establish a DAO, with working trustless governance. There are at this time no time estimates for when this can be accomplished. All are welcome to discuss how the future DAO should work by participating on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/WyyeTBjqCu) server.
